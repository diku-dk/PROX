--- Install Tools -------------------------

Make sure you got latest CMake installed on your system and your favorite IDE/compiler.

--- Install dependencies ------------------

Before compiling and linking one needs to install Boost, Glew, Glut, Atlas.

Atlas is not a strong dependency and could be omitted. However, it is
there then FOUNDATION/BIG will take advantage of it.

--- Dependencies on Apple -----------------

Glut and Atlas are already bundled with Mac, so no need to do anything for this.

Other dependencies can be easy installed using macport (you need to install macport if you do not already have it)

sudo port install boost@1.53.0_1+no_single+no_static+python27+universal
sudo port install glew@1.9.0_0+universal
sudo port install libdevil@1.7.8+universal

--- Dependencies on Linux -----------------

--- Ubuntu based versions -----------------

Install dependencies:

  $ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake cmake-curses-gui freeglut3-dev libboost-all-dev libglew-dev libxi-dev libxmu-dev libdevil-dev --assume-yes
  $ sudo apt-get install libatlas-dev libatlas3gf-base libatlas-base-dev --assume-yes

This has been tested on a Precise64 Virtual Box and results in the following versions:
- gcc (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.3-1ubuntu5)
- cmake version 2.8.7
- libglut.so.3.9.0, libGLU.so.1.3.08004, libGLEW.so.1.6.0, libGL.so.1.2
- Boost 1.46.1
- libXi.so.6.1.0, libXmu.so.6.2.0
- libatlas.so.3gf.0 with libcblas.so.3gf.0 and liblapack_atlas.so.3gf.0

--- Howto compile and link  ------------------------

CMake should be used for generating make/solution files.

Open the cmake gui application

Browse the source path to the top most folder containing a CMakeLists.txt file.

For binary destination use the same folder location but add a
subfolder to contain the binary tree. You can name it whatever you
want. For instance "build". Press configure button, resolve any conflicts or issues.

If you want to have unit-testing find the cmake variable ENABLE_UNIT_TESTS and set it to true (=1)

Press configure button again until no red variables appear. Now press generate button.

Goto the build folder and locate your solution/make files and use these to compile and link the sub project.
